# meta-xt-rcar-gen4 #

This repository contains Renesas R-Car Gen4-specific Yocto layers for
Xen Troops distro. Some layers in this repository are product-independent.
They provide common facilities that may be used by any xt-based product
that runs on Renesas Gen4-based platforms.

Those layers *may* be added and used manually, but they were written
with [Moulin](https://moulin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) build system,
as Moulin-based project files provide correct entries in local.conf

# Status

This is a release 0.5.3 of the Xen-based development product for the
S4 Spider board.

This release provides the following features:

 - Xen build compatible with S4 SoC
 - Thin Dom0
 - Driver domain (DomD), which has access to all available hardware
 - Optional generic domain (DomU)
 - Support for OP-TEE in virtualization mode
 - ICCOM partitioning demo (proprietary components are required to
   test the feature)
 - Initial support for VMQ.

The following HW modules were tested and are confirmed to work:

 - Serial console (HSCIF)
 - IPMMUs
 - R-Switch (tsn0 interface only)
 - eMMC
 - PCIe with ITS

# External dependencies

At least IPL 0.5.0 is required for normal operation. Release was
tested with IPL 0.7.0. User is required to flash ARM TF
(bl31-spider.srec) and OP-TEE (tee-spider.srec) provided by the build
to ensure that Xen and DomD/DomU will work correctly.

# Building
## Requirements

1. Ubuntu 18.0+ or any other Linux distribution which is supported by Poky/OE
2. Development packages for Yocto. Refer to [Yocto
   manual](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#brief-build-system-packages).
3. You need `Moulin` installed in your PC. Recommended way is to
   install it for your user only: `pip3 install --user
   git+https://github.com/xen-troops/moulin`. Make sure that your
   `PATH` environment variable includes `${HOME}/.local/bin`.
4. Ninja build system: `sudo apt install ninja-build` on Ubuntu

## Fetching

You can fetch/clone this whole repository, but you actually only need
one file from it: `prod-devel-rcar-s4.yaml`. During the build `moulin`
will fetch this repository again into `yocto/` directory. So, to
reduce possible confuse, we recommend to download only
`prod-devel-rcar-s4.yaml`:

```
# curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xen-troops/meta-xt-prod-devel-rcar-gen4/spider-0.5.3/prod-devel-rcar-s4.yaml
```

## Building

Moulin is used to generate Ninja build file: `moulin
prod-devel-rcar-s4.yaml`. This project provides number of additional
parameters. You can check them with `--help-config` command
line option:

```
# moulin prod-devel-rcar-s4.yaml --help-config
usage: moulin prod-devel-rcar-s4.yaml [--ENABLE_DOMU {no,yes}]

Config file description: Xen-Troops development setup for Renesas RCAR Gen4
hardware

optional arguments:
  --ENABLE_DOMU {no,yes}
                        Build generic Yocto-based DomU
```

Only one machine is supported as of now: `spider`. You can enable or
disable DomU build with `--ENABLE_DOMU=yes` option.
Be default it is disabled.

So, to build with DomU (generic Yocto-based virtual machine) use the
following command line: `moulin prod-devel-rcar-s4.yaml
--ENABLE_DOMU=yes`.

Moulin will generate `build.ninja` file. After that run `ninja` to
build the images. This will take some time and disk space as it builds
3 separate Yocto images.

## Creating SD card image

### Using Ninja

Latest versions of `moulin` will generate additional ninja targets for
creating images. In case of this product please use

```
# ninja image-full
```

To generate SD/eMMC image `full.img`. You can use `dd` tool to write
this image file to a SD card:

```
# dd if=full.img of=/dev/sdX conv=sparse
```

If you want to write image directly to a SD card (e.g. without
creating `full.img` file), you will need to use manual mode, which is
described in the next subsection.

### Manually, using `rouge`

Image file can be created with `rouge` tool. This is a companion
application for `moulin`.

Right now it works only in standalone mode, so manual invocation is
required. It accepts the same parameters: `--ENABLE_DOMU`.

This XT product provides only one image: `full`.

You can prepare the image by running

```
# rouge prod-devel-rcar-s4.yaml --ENABLE_DOMU=yes -i full
```

This will create file `full.img` in your current directory.

Also you can write image directly to an SD card by running

```
# sudo rouge prod-devel-rcar.yaml --ENABLE_DOMU=yes -i full -so /dev/sdX
```

**BE SURE TO PROVIDE CORRECT DEVICE NAME**. `rouge` has no
interactive prompts and will overwrite your device right away. **ALL
DATA WILL BE LOST**.

It is also possible to flash the image to the internal eMMC.
For that you may want booting the board via TFTP and sharing DomD's
root file system via NFS. Once booted it is possible to flash the image:

```
# dd if=/full.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M
```

For more information about `rouge` check its
[manual](https://moulin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rouge.html).

## U-boot environment

Please make sure 'bootargs' variable is unset while running with Xen:
```
unset bootargs
```

It is possible to run the build from TFTP+NFS and eMMC. With NFS boot
is is possible to configure board IP, server IP and NFS path for DomD
and DomU. Please set the following environment for that:

```
setenv set_pcie 'i2c dev 0; i2c mw 0x6c 0x26 5; i2c mw 0x6c 0x254.2 0x1e; i2c mw 0x6c 0x258.2 0x1e'
